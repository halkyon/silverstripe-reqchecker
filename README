# SilverStripe Requirements Checker

This script will check your server environment to make sure it is configured correctly
for SilverStripe (http://silverstripe.org).

Currently it only checks PHP configuration. Future enhancements include checking Apache,
IIS 7.x and MySQL database, as well as file permissions.

## Using

 1. Copy silverstripe_requirements.php to somewhere in your webroot, e.g. /var/www/
 2. Fire up a browser and point to that file, e.g. "http://localhost/silverstripe_requirements.php"
